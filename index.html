                The tree missed the days the kids used to come by and play. It still wore the tire swing the kids had put up in its branches years ago although
                both the tire and the rope had seen better days. The tree had watched all the kids in the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it wondered if
                there would ever be a time when another child played and laughed again under its branches. That was the hope that the tree wished every day as
                the swing gently swung empty in the wind.

                Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also
                committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come
                with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs
                down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.

                Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera. She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled through thousands of images on
                your computer. She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken. She could remember where she had been, what she was thinking as she
                tried to get the shot, the smells of the surrounding area, and even the emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering
                what she had for breakfast.

                The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound of the shower's running water. It was the same way each day began since he could
                remember. It listened intently and concluded that the singing today was as terrible as it had ever been.

                Nobody really understood Kevin. It wasn't that he was super strange or difficult. It was more that there wasn't enough there that anyone wanted
                to take the time to understand him. This was a shame as Kevin had many of the answers to the important questions most people who knew him had.
                It was even more of a shame that they'd refuse to listen even if Kevin offered to give them the answers. So, Kevin remained silent,
                misunderstood, and kept those important answers to life to himself.

                The day had begun on a bright note. The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were singing in its
                warmth. There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.
